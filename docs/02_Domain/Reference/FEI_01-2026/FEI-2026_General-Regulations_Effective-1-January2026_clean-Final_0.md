    conditions to all participating Horses and Athletes, for example in relation to transport,
    accommodation, meals etc.  
2.  The GRs and Sport Rules govern the conduct of all International Equestrian Events organised
    by NFs or by or on behalf of the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI).

    minimum of thirty (30) NFs from at least four (4) geographical groups with a total
    participation of a minimum of ten thousand (10,000) Athletes. It must also involve a true
    collaboration between Athlete and Horse at an advanced standard of training, respect the
    classical equestrian ideas, exemplify the FEI standards of sportsmanship and fully respect
    the Horse’s welfare.
6.  FEI Statutes, GRs, and Sport Rules apply to International Events and/or Competitions as set
    forth in Chapter l.

    responsible for ensuring the payment of prize money in instances in which an agreement
    has been entered into by and among the FEI, the NF and the OC. OCs shall take measures
    as may be necessary to cover their financial and legal liabilities, such as guaranteeing the
    prize money.
    7.4. To ensure that any Event is correctly managed by OCs, and to ensure the implementation
    of draft schedules approved by the FEI.
8.  By 1 January 2027, NFs must have incorporated:

2.  Individual foreign Athletes, other than “Athletes Living Outside their Country of Nationality”
    (Article 119.6), may take part in CNs provided they have obtained written permission
    from their own NF and from the NF of the OC concerned. Permission must state the exact
    period for which it has been granted and the home NF of individual foreign Athletes shall
    indicate their level in writing so that they are entered in Events of appropriate level.
3.  3.1 Not counting “Athletes Living Outside their Country of Nationality” (Article 119.6), a CN
    with more than 4 NFs and/or more than fifteen (15) foreign Athletes is allowed if it would
    be within the requirements of a CIM. If a CN under such conditions takes place, there will
    be no ranking or qualification points earned.
    3.2 Any other CN with more than four (4) NFs and/or more than fifteen (15) foreign Athletes
    (not counting “Athletes Living Outside their Country of Nationality” as per Article 119.6) is
    not allowed. If a CN under such conditions takes place, there will be no ranking or
    qualification points earned. Furthermore, after consultation with the NF, the OC can be
    subject to further sanctions and eventually to a fine in an amount commensurate with the
    violation and taking into account the circumstances of the violation and possibly up to the

    a FEI CSIO-Series Event. Unless otherwise specified in these General Regulations or the
    relevant Sports Rules, all references to CIO shall include both categories of CSIO. The
    designation of an Event as a FEI CSIO-Series Event shall be at the discretion of the FEI in
    consultation with the relevant NF (according to the consultation process set out in the
    Allocation of FEI Named Events Policy) and is reserved for Events that have been selected
    by the FEI for inclusion in the FEI Team Jumping Series for Nations, the official name of

CHAPTER II - PARTICIPATION OF ATHLETES AND HORSES

Article 113 - Registration and Eligibility of Athletes and Horses

1.  All Athletes and Horses must be registered with the FEI, and their own NF, or where
    appropriate with their host NF, before they can be entered and permitted to take part in an
    International Event, unless otherwise specified by the Sport Rules. (See also Article 119-
    Sport Nationality Status of Athletes and Chapter V Horses).
2.  NFs are responsible for registering all Athletes and Horses and shall ensure that such
    Athletes have the appropriate corresponding sport nationality pursuant to Article 119. NFs
    are also responsible for unregistering any Athlete and/or Horse that are not competing
    anymore for any reason.
3.  Any Athlete and/or any Horse not registered with the FEI and/or not fulfilling an eligibility
    requirement shall be automatically disqualified, unless compelling circumstances warrant
    otherwise.
4.  An Athlete and/or Horse, even if registered with the FEI, is not eligible to participate in an
    International Event or National Event (and so may not be invited by an OC to such Event or
    entered by an NF in such Event) if that Athlete and/or Horse has participated, in the six (6)
    months prior to the first day of the International Event or National Event in question, in an
    Unsanctioned Event.
5.  For purposes of Article 113.4, an ‘Unsanctioned Event’ is an event and/or a competition that
    is neither published in the official Calendar nor authorised by an NF and/or a National Event
    authorised or organised by a NF that is suspended by the FEI. Please also refer to the
    Appendix J for the rationale for the Unsanctioned Event Provisions.
6.  The FEI may only apply Article 113.4, if the FEI has either (i) informed the Athletes and
    Owners, via the NF(s) with whom the Athlete/Horse is registered/administered by, of the
    competition(s) or event(s) that are considered as Unsanctioned Event(s) and/or (ii)
    published the list of such Unsanctioned Event(s) on FEI website so that Athletes, Chefs
    d’Equipe, Owners, or NFs are on notice, such notification/publication to occur no later than
    seven (7) days prior to the relevant competition(s) or event(s).  
7.  Where it is then alleged by the FEI that a person participated in an Unsanctioned Event, the
    FEI shall notify the relevant person(s) of the alleged participation in an Unsanctioned Event
    and shall give such person(s) an opportunity to be heard in either written or oral form.
8.  Any Decision of the FEI Secretary General to apply Article 113.4 may be appealed to the FEI
    Tribunal in accordance with Article 162.5 of the FEI General Regulations and the Internal
    Regulations of the FEI Tribunal.
9.  Instead of applying the sanctions provided for in Article 113.4 the FEI may issue:

<!-- -->

1.  a “no fault” finding where:

<!-- -->

1.  the Athlete and/or Horse participated in an event that would clearly have been
    sanctioned by the FEI or the NF but for administrative error by the organiser of the
    Unsanctioned Event; or

2.  exceptional circumstances exist; or

<!-- -->

1.  a “Warning” in circumstances where the Athlete or Owner was reasonably aware that
    the event was not sanctioned (and there is no suggestion of an administrative error by the
    organiser) but has demonstrated that the event otherwise adhered to the objectives of the
    FEI as stated in the Appendix J.
    Article 114 - Horse Identification

<!-- -->

1.  The OC shall give an identification number to each of the participating Horses.
2.  The identification number must be worn during the whole Event at all times when the Horse
    is out of the Event stables.

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 14

Article 115 - Invitations

1.  The FEI may impose a specific online system to manage invitations, provided the Secretary
    General has duly informed the OCs and NFs of such requirement with sufficient prior written
    notice. Invitations for individual Athletes to take part in CIs must be sent to the NFs of the
    Athletes concerned. Invitations from OCs must be sent to the NFs of the Athletes concerned.
    Invitations must include copies of the schedule. The percentage of Athletes personally
    invited by OCs shall be specified in the Sport Rules for the specific Disciplines. However,
    these invitations from OCs (foreign and/or home Athletes) must be under the same
    conditions as for other Athletes and must in no way be directly or indirectly in connection
    with a financial contribution. Pay Cards and appearance fees, even in the form of VIP tables
    and Event privileges, are strictly prohibited and will be sanctioned.  
2.  Invitations to take part in CIOs may only be sent from the host NF directly to other NFs and
    must stipulate the number of Athletes and Horses that may be included in the official team
    and the number of individual entries that can be accepted.
3.  At CIOs the number of invited NFs may be limited according to the schedule of the Event as
    approved by the FEI and the Sport Rules of the relevant Discipline.
4.  Unless the relevant Sport Rules provide otherwise, the announcement of the approved date
    and place of a Championship automatically counts as an invitation to all NFs eligible to
    participate. Intentions to participate must be sent to the host NF as soon as possible.  
5.  All Athletes taking part in CIs, FEI Championships and Games must be given the same
    allowances and conditions. If similar accommodation facilities are not available for all
    Athletes and their Horses, allocation shall be decided by a draw.

Article 116 - Entries

1.  The FEI may impose a specific online Entry System to be used by OCs and NFs to manage
    Athlete and Horse entries, provided the Secretary General has duly informed the OCs and
    NFs of such requirement with sufficient prior written notice. If the entries of Athletes and
    Horses are not made through such online Entry System as imposed by the FEI (if applicable),
    such entries shall not be accepted by the FEI. In addition, any Athlete and Horse competing
    in any Competition without having being entered through any online Entry System as
    imposed by the FEI will be disqualified by the FEI, unless compelling circumstances warrant
    otherwise. If an online Entry System is imposed by the FEI, the Secretary General shall
    establish and make available to OCs and NFs guidelines detailing all relevant information
    and processes.

2.  Entries for FEI Championships and FEI World Equestrian Games™

2.1 All Athletes invited or nominated must be entered by their NFs. All Athletes selected by their
NFs, in accordance with the relevant Sport Rules and as specified in the Schedule, must be
accepted by the OC. OCs may not accept any other entries.

2.2 Entries shall be made following the compulsory two (2) phases outlined below:

1.  Nominated entries
    Must be made at least four (4) weeks before the Event and must include a list of the names
    of Athletes and Horses from which the definite entries and any substitutions will be chosen
    and state the number of Athletes and Horses which the NF intends to send. The number of
    nominated entries of Athletes and Horses must not exceed twice the number invited in the
    Schedule or prescribed by the Sport Rules. Once the nominated entries have been sent in,
    NFs may send fewer Athletes and/or Horses but never more than the number of nominated
    entries. NFs which are not represented after having made nominated entries and whose
    excuse is not acceptable to the OC shall be reported by the OC to the Secretary General for
    consideration of their excuse by the FEI Tribunal.

2.  Definite entries
    Must be made at the latest four (4) days preceding the beginning of the Event. These
    represent the final selection of Athletes and Horses that will travel to the Event. The definite
    entries may not exceed the number listed and must be chosen from the list of names on the
    nominated entries. After the definite entries have been sent in, substitutions of Athletes
    and/or Horses may only be made with the express permission of the OC.

2.3 Entries for Athletes and Horses must include their name, FEI registration number (FEI ID)
and, where appropriate, qualifications.

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 15

1.  Entries for all other International Events:

3.1 Entries for each Discipline shall be regulated in the each relevant Sport Rules., except for
any FEI Championship and for the FEI World Equestrian Games where this Article shall apply.

3.2. Definite entries must be made at the latest four (4) days preceding the beginning of the
Event. These represent the final selection of Athletes and Horses that may participate in the
Event. Substitutions of Athletes and/or Horses may only be made in accordance with the
relevant Sport Rules.

1.  Should an NF send more Athletes and/or Horses than shown in the nominated entry the OC
    is not obliged to accommodate them or to allow them to participate in that Event even if the
    Sport Rules and schedule would allow such participation.
2.  At an Event, an Athlete may withdraw any or all their Horses from a competition, but they
    may not add a Horse not previously entered for that competition without the approval of the
    OC and the Ground Jury.
3.  Where an NF has made a nominated entry of a team and finds that it will be unable to send
    a team, it must immediately inform the OC.
4.  Except as otherwise specified in the relevant Sports Rules, Teams or individual Athletes who
    have been definitely entered by their NFs at any Event and fail to take part without valid
    excuse must be reported by the Foreign Judge/Technical Delegate to the Secretary General
    for consideration by the FEI Tribunal. Competing at another Event staged at the same time
    does not constitute a valid excuse for failure to participate at an Event. Withdrawals after
    the date of definite entries or no-shows will result in the Person Responsible being liable to
    reimburse the OC for any financial loss incurred by the OC (i.e. stabling and accommodation
    if provided by the OC, as mentioned in the schedule) as a result of such late withdrawal or
    no-show.
5.  Unless otherwise provided in the Sport Rules, an NF cannot make definite entries for the
    same Athlete/Horse combination to more than one (1) OC for the same time period on
    penalty of disqualification of such Athlete/Horse combination from the Event in which they
    eventually participate.

Article 117 - Selection of Representative Teams and Individuals

1.  NFs have the final responsibility for the selection of all Athletes and Horses to participate in
    any International Event or to represent their countries at CIOs, FEI Championships, FEI
    Regional, Olympic Games, and Paralympic Games provided that the Athletes and Horses are
    qualified in all respects under the conditions set forth for each Event and the Athlete has the
    sport nationality of the NF for whom they are competing in accordance with Article 119
    (Sport Nationality Status of Athletes) below.  
2.  NFs are responsible for selecting and entering qualified Horses and Athletes. This includes
    the fitness and capability of the Horses and the Athletes to participate in the
    Events/Categories for which they are entered
3.  Only Horses and Athletes in possession of approved Certificates of Capability may be entered
    for FEI World Championships and Olympic Games, (Appendix C) in accordance with the
    applicable Sport Rules and Olympic Regulations.
4.  Only Athletes properly licensed by NFs and having the sport nationality of the nominating
    NF may be accepted as entries for CIs.
5.  Athletes whose NF has been suspended or expelled may not be accepted as entries for any
    International Event, or national Event outside the country of their NF, during the period of
    the Suspension or expulsion, unless otherwise approved by the Board.
6.  No Athlete may take part “hors concours” in any International Competition unless otherwise
    specified by the Sport Rules of the relevant Discipline.
7.  No Athlete may be accepted as an entry for any International Event under any other name
    than that appearing on their licence.

Article 118 - Person Responsible

1.  The Person Responsible for a Horse has legal responsibility for that Horse, including
    responsibility under the GRs and the VRs and unless otherwise stated is liable under the
    Legal System (Chapter VIII).  
2.  It is the obligation of the Person Responsible and of every other person subject to the
    Statutes, GRs and Sport Rules to know the Statutes, GRs and relevant Sport Rules, and lack
    of such knowledge does not relieve these persons from liabilities under the Statutes, GRs
    and Sport Rules.

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 16

1.  The Person Responsible shall be the Athlete who rides, vaults or drives the Horse during an
    Event, but the Owner and other Support Personnel including but not limited to grooms and
    veterinarians may be regarded as additional Persons Responsible if they are present at the
    Event or have made a relevant Decision about the Horse. In vaulting, the lunger shall be an
    additional Person Responsible. In Endurance, the Trainer shall be the additional Person
    Responsible.
2.  Athlete under 18 years of age (Minor Athlete):
    4.1 If the Athlete is under 18 years of age when the entry is submitted, the NF or Chef d’Equipe
    must nominate a representative for the Athlete.  
    4.2 The representative may be a parent of the Athlete, the Chef d’Equipe, the team coach, the
    team veterinarian, the Owner or some other responsible adult and shall be communicated
    to the OC and the NF with the entry.  
    4.3 If the NF and Chef d’Equipe fail to nominate the representative, either parent of the Athlete
    may be considered as the representative.  
    4.4 The Minor Athlete shall remain the Person Responsible, unless compelling circumstances
    warrant otherwise.
    4.5 The representative may represent the minor Person Responsible in all dealings with the OC,
    the NFs and the FEI Officials, including, but not limited to, witnessing the medication
    process.  
    4.6 When the representative is from another NF than the Person Responsible’s, all
    communications shall take place through the Person Responsible’s NF.

    Horse under their jurisdiction.
    6 Persons Responsible are responsible for any act performed in the stables to any Horse under
    their jurisdiction, by themselves or by any other person with access to the Horse, and are
    responsible while riding, driving or exercising any Horse under their jurisdiction. Persons
    Responsible are not relieved from such responsibility as a result of the lack or insufficiency
    of stable security.
4.  If, for any reason, the Person Responsible is unable or is prevented from caring for the
    Horses under their jurisdiction they must immediately notify the Secretary of the OC and
    the Veterinary Commission.  
5.  In the context of betting, the Person Responsible and/or any Support Personnel must not,
    by any manner whatsoever, infringe the principle of fair play, show non-sporting conduct,

    Chapter X of the Statutes.

3. Sport nationality and sport nationality changes: Minor Athletes  
3.1 A Minor Athlete who is a citizen of more than one country can choose each calendar year
which NF the Minor Athlete wants to represent.
3.2 A Minor Athlete may subsequently change their NF (only once per calendar year). Such
change of NF is subject to the previous NF’s, the new NF’s and the FEI’s approvals if the
Minor Athlete has already participated in an international event for another NF since 1
January of that calendar year.

circumstances, the Athlete will be compelled to inform their “own NF” as well as the FEI.
6.3 A Minor Athlete who has always competed for their country of residence and not their own
NF, may apply to the FEI to establish their country of residence as their own NF once the
Minor Athlete turns eighteen (18), even though the Minor Athlete is not a national of such
country, only if: (i) the Minor Athlete has never competed under the flag of their own NF;
(ii) the country of residence, in the FEI’s opinion, qualifies as a country where obtaining
nationality is overly burdensome; (iii) the Minor Athlete has a valid identity card or residence

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 18

permit for the country of residence, or other equivalent document; and (iii) the Minor Athlete
has been a resident of the country of residence for at least the last five (5) consecutive
years. The FEI shall have sole discretion to grant or deny an application presented under
this provision, weighing the best interests of equestrian sport against the best interests of
the Minor Athlete.

Article 136 - Age of Horses

Age restrictions on Horses taking part in FEI competitions shall be specified in the relevant
Sport Rules.

Article 137 - Horse Passports and Microchips

1.  Every Horse entered for any Competition at CIMs (see Appendix E) in a country other than
    the country of the Horse’s residency, and all Horses entered for other CIs, FEI
    Championships, Regional, Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, at all times, must have
    an official, valid FEI passport, or a national passport approved by the FEI and inserted inside
    an FEI Recognition Card. In the case of Horses permanently resident in a Member State of
    the European Union, all Horses must have an acceptable national EU approved passport in
    compliance with Commission Regulations, to which an FEI recognition card is applied. The
    exception to the latter being the possession of an FEI passport which has been continually
    revalidated without any interruption.
2.  Notwithstanding the paragraph above, Horses taking part in CIMs (see Appendix E) in their
    country of residence are not required to have a FEI Passport or FEI Recognition Card as
    mentioned in paragraph 1. All such Horses must be properly registered with the FEI and
    identifiable. All Horses permanently resident within a Member State of the European Union
    must have as a minimum a suitable national EU approved passport in compliance with
    Commission Regulation.
    As of 1 January 2017 the following requirements apply to Horses that are registered with
    the FEI for the first time: (i) to be identifiable at least by a National Passport approved by
    the FEI or a FEI Passport; and (ii) scans of the required pages of the National Passports
    approved by the FEI and/or FEI Documents must be uploaded by the NFs to the FEI Database
    prior to the Horse being definitely entered in the Event.  
3.  All FEI and/or national passports must include the full name, address and signature of the
    Owner as registered by the NF. The description of the Horse and the diagram must be
    accurately completed in order to be acceptable, and the FEI and/or national passport must
    include a record of all vaccinations and medication control tests. Whenever the name of a
    Horse with an FEI and/or national passport is changed, or any pertinent changes are made
    to an FEI and/or National Passport, the NF must notify the FEI.
4.  NFs are responsible for issuing FEI passports and FEI Recognition Cards for all Horses
    required to have them and for ensuring that the FEI and/or national passports are correctly
    completed, as specified in the VRs, prior to being authenticated by the stamp of the NF and
    the signature of an Official of the NF. In all cases NFs must be content that the description
    of the Horse must be accurately completed to a suitable standard. NFs must provide the
    identification page to the FEI for registration. The Person Responsible for a Horse at an Event
    is responsible for the accuracy of the FEI and/or national passport and for presenting it at
    the passport control, except for Events with borrowed Horses (Article 111) where it is the
    responsibility of the host NF.
    4.1 As of 1 January 2010 the FEI does not issue passports for horses which are statutory subject
    to the European Union identification requirements laid down in Commission Regulation. Art.
    1010 and Annex XVII, VRs apply to EU Horses documentation procedures. The exception
    being the revalidation of an FEI passport that has been continuously revalidated without
    interruption.  
5.  A Horse may only have one FEI passport or one national passport with an FEI Recognition
    Card as per paragraph 1 of this Article and one permanent FEI number. If an NF is satisfied
    that an FEI and/or national passport has been lost or if any section of the FEI and/or national
    passport is full, it must issue an FEI and/or national passport clearly marked “duplicate” and
    bearing the same number as the original FEI passport. The issue of a duplicate FEI and/or
    national passport must be reported to the FEI (see VRs).
6.  OCs must arrange for each Horse to be positively identified at the passport control during
    the examination on arrival, in accordance with the VRs. Any case of misleading or inaccurate
    information in an FEI and/or national passport, or if the Horse cannot be positively identified,
    must be reported to the President of the Ground Jury, who must report the case to the FEI,
    giving the number of the FEI and/or national passport with the FEI Recognition Card and the
    name of the Horse.
7.  If any Horse arrives at a CI, FEI Championship, Regional Games or Olympic Games without
    an FEI and/or national passport with an FEI Recognition Card, or if its FEI or national
    passport is inaccurate, it must not be allowed to compete unless the Ground Jury) gives its
    approval. Only in exceptional circumstances may a Horse without an FEI or national passport
    or without an FEI Recognition Card be allowed to compete.

    name under which it was originally registered by its NF, and this name must remain
    permanently in the passport.
2.  The first registered name may not be the name of a commercial company or product. If this
    name is considered to be the name of a commercial company or product, a new first
    registered name must be entered and remain permanently in the passport.
3.  A commercial prefix or suffix may be added to the name mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2
    above, and must be entered in the passport. However, at Regional and Olympic Games
    under the patronage of the IOC, such prefix or suffix cannot appear in a programme or be
    used in any other way.
4.  If a new first name shall be used and entered in the passport and/or the commercial
    prefix/suffix be changed, the Horse must carry the new name and/or the new prefix/suffix
    for the next twelve (12) months as follows: new name and/or new prefix/suffix ex previous
    name/prefix/ suffix (see VRs).

Article 139 - Owners and Lessees of Horses

1.  NFs must keep a register of the Owners and lessees of Horses with official passports.

    national passport and authenticated by the stamp and signature of an NF official.
2.  The nationality of a Horse is that of its Owner or of the Lessee, where a lease is current, or
    of the country in which the company owning or leasing it is registered. A company may,
    however, own a Horse in partnership with an individual.  
3.  When one or more Horses belong to a partnership of Owners of different nationalities, the
    Owners must declare to the FEI, before making the first entry, the nationality under which
    the Horse or Horses will compete and that nationality must be entered in the FEI and/or
    national passport. The Horses must retain that nationality until the partnership is dissolved
    or the Horses are sold. Any consequent change of nationality must be reported to the FEI.
4.  Horses entered for the Olympic Games must be the property of Owners of the same
    nationality as the Athlete by 15th January of the year of the Games (see Olympic
    Regulations).

<!-- -->

1.  a “no fault” finding where:  

<!-- -->

1.  the Official participated in an event that would clearly have been sanctioned
    by the FEI or the NF but for administrative error by the organiser of the
    Unsanctioned Event; or  
2.  exceptional circumstances exist ; or  

<!-- -->

1.  a “Warning” in circumstances where the Official was reasonably aware that the
    event was not sanctioned (and there is no suggestion of an administrative error by
    the organiser) but has demonstrated that the event otherwise adhered to the
    objectives of the FEI as stated in the Appendix J.

under the Administrative Disciplinary Procedure, the FEI will submit the case to the FEI
Tribunal for adjudication in accordance with the Internal Regulations of the FEI Tribunal.

considered as “Minor”. If, following the disciplinary proceedings before the FEI Tribunal, the

in question, the FEI Tribunal shall impose a higher Sanction/Sanctions than those provided
for in the list of Minor Sanctions.

or teleconference) and/or by way of a written submission prior to the FEI issuing its Decision.

163.9 After the accused person has exercised their right to be heard (or where the accused person
has waived such right), the accused person will be notified in writing of the FEI’s Decision.
Decisions under the Administrative Disciplinary Procedure will be taken by FEI Headquarters,
acting through the FEI Legal Department.

163.10 Decision issued under the Administrative Disciplinary Procedure may be appealed to the FEI
Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of Article 165.2. In the related appeal
proceedings, if the FEI’s original Decision is upheld and the appeal is dismissed the FEI
Tribunal shall impose a higher Sanction/Sanctions than those provided for in the list of Minor
Sanctions.

163.11 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in urgent cases the FEI may impose an immediate Provisional
Suspension via the Minor Offence Notice of Charge, via a Notification Letter in Claim
proceedings and/or via a Notice of open investigation. The Provisional Suspension will remain
in effect until such time as FEI Headquarters or the FEI Tribunal (as the case may be) issues
its Decision or unless and until the Provisional Suspension is lifted in accordance with Article
163.12 below.

APPENDIX F - FEI CODE OF ETHICS

To recognize the interests of all the constituencies of equestrianism including National Federations,
Athletes, Owners, Organisers, Officials, grooms, sponsors, and the FEI itself to foster their
harmonious collaboration and to formalise the collective commitment to the Olympic ideal.

The achievement of this goal and the image of Equestrian Sport are dependent on the respect of the
following ethical principles that are compatible with maintenance of the values, spirit and ideals of
Equestrian Sport and its part in the Olympic Movement.

Consequently, all participants in Equestrian Sport, including but not limited to Athletes (and their
Support Personnel), Owners, Organisers, Officials, grooms, sponsors, and FEI volunteers and staff
undertake to respect and be bound at all times by the present Code, and by the IOC Code of Ethics
where applicable.

A. DIGNITY
1. Safeguarding the dignity of the equine and human Athlete is a fundamental requirement of
equestrianism.
2. There shall be no discrimination between the human Athletes on the basis of race, gender,
ethnic origin, religion, philosophical or political opinion, marital status or other grounds.
3. All doping practices at all levels are strictly prohibited. The provisions against doping in the
Equine Anti-Doping and Controlled Medication Regulations and the FEI Anti-Doping Rules for
Human Athletes shall be scrupulously observed.
4. All forms of harassment of Athletes, be it physical, professional or sexual, and any physical
or mental injuries to participants, are prohibited.
5. All forms of participation in, or support for betting on the Olympic Games, and all forms of
promotion of betting related to the Olympic Game are prohibited.
6. Also, in the context of betting, participants in the Olympic Games and FEI Events must not,
by any manner whatsoever, infringe the principle of fair play, show non-sporting conduct,
or attempt to influence the result of a competition in a manner contrary to sporting ethics.
7. FEI constituents shall guarantee the Athletes conditions of safety, well-being and medical
care favourable to their physical and mental equilibrium.

B. INTEGRITY & ANTI-CORRUPTION
1. FEI representatives shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, accept or offer any form of
personal remuneration or commission, nor any concealed benefit or service of any nature,
connected with the organisation of FEI Events that is not part of the official negotiation
process or set forth in the contract with the Organiser or Organising Committee.
2. Only gifts of nominal value, in accordance with prevailing local customs, may be given or
accepted by FEI Board members, FEI volunteers, or FEI staff by or to any member of an
Organising Committee bidding for an FEI Event, as a mark of respect or friendship. Any
other gift must be passed on to the organisation of which the beneficiary is a member.
3. The hospitality shown by any Organising Committee bidding for an FEI Event to the
volunteers and members of FEI staff as well as persons accompanying them, shall not
exceed the standards prevailing in the host country.
4. Conflicts of interest, whether real or perceived, are to be avoided.
5. Even the appearance of misconduct or impropriety should be recognized as damaging to the
FEI’s reputation, and should therefore be avoided.
6. FEI constituents must not be involved with organisations, firms or persons whose activity or
reputation is inconsistent with the principles set out in the present Code.

C. GOOD GOVERNANCE AND RESOURCES
1. The basic universal principles of good governance of the FEI, in particular transparency,
responsibility and accountability, must be respected by all FEI constituents.
2. The resources available to FEI volunteers and staff may be used only for FEI purposes.
3. The FEI’s income and expenditures shall be recorded in its accounts, which must be
maintained in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An independent
auditor will check these accounts.  
4. In cases where the FEI gives financial support to any National Federation, Organising
Committee, or other person or entity:  
a) The use of these FEI resources must be clearly demonstrated in the accounts of the recipient;
b) The accounts of the recipient may be subjected to auditing by an expert designated by the
FEI Executive Board upon reasonable notice to the recipient.
5. FEI constituents recognise the significant contribution that broadcasters, sponsors, partners
and other supporters of equestrian events make to the development and prestige of FEI
Events throughout the world. However, such support must be in a form consistent with the
rules of sport and the principles defined in the FEI Rules and Regulations, the Olympic
Charter and the present Code. They must not interfere in the running of the sport. The

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 58

organisation and staging of Equestrian competitions are the exclusive responsibility of the
FEI and, where appropriate of the National Federations and/or Organisers recognised by the
FEI.
D. BIDDING FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS/EVENTS
The documents and/or information published by the FEI linked to the selection of host Organisers of
the FEI World Equestrian Games/FEI Championships and FEI World Cup Finals shall be respected.  
The cities wishing to organise these FEI events shall, refrain from approaching another party, or a
third authority, with a view to obtaining any financial or political support inconsistent with the
provisions of such documents and/or information and/or the present Code.

E. RELATIONS WITH STATES
1. National Federations and/or Organising Committees shall work to maintain harmonious
relations with state authorities, in accordance with the principles of universality and political
neutrality.
2. National Federations and/or Organising Committees are free to play a role in the public life
of the states to which they belong. They may not, however, engage in any activity or follow
any ideology inconsistent with the principles and rules defined in the Olympic Charter and
set out in the present Code.
3. National Federations and/or Organising Committees shall endeavour to protect the
environment on the occasion of any events they organise.

F. CONFIDENTIALITY
FEI constituents shall not disclose information entrusted to them in confidence. Disclosure of other
information shall not be for personal gain or benefit, nor be undertaken maliciously to damage the
reputation of any person or organisation.

G. IMPLEMENTATION
1. The FEI Headquarters shall see to it that the principles and rules of FEI Rules and
Regulations, the Olympic Charter and the present Code are applied.
2. The FEI Headquarters shall inform the FEI President of any breach of the present Code, with
a view to possible referral to an FEI Ethics Panel or the Equestrian Community Integrity Unit.
3. The FEI Executive Board may, if it wishes, set out the provisions for the implementation of
the present Code in a set of Implementing Provisions.

The principles listed above form the FEI Code of Ethics which all FEI constituents must comply with
as a condition of representing or participating in FEI activities in any form and under any
circumstances.

APPENDIX H - FEI OFFICIALS’ CODE OF CONDUCT

As an FEI Official I undertake to respect all FEI Rules and Regulations at all times, and in particular
the FEI Code of Ethics and Conflict of Interest Policy and the FEI Code of Conduct for the Welfare of
the Horse.
I am aware that I am a representative of the FEI while officiating at any FEI Event (hereinafter the
“Event/s”). I am also conscious of my role as an authority and of the associated obligation to have
adequate knowledge of the principles of equestrian sport and the relevant FEI Rules and Regulations,
and to apply them at all times in a fair and consistent way.  
I will fulfill all FEI requirements (including maintaining the necessary qualification) relevant to each
Event to which I am appointed.
While I am officiating:  
• I will act in an appropriate and respectful manner towards humans and animals, paying
constant attention to their safety and I will carry out all duties in a professional manner.
• I will refrain from consuming alcohol and I will not use any substances and/or medications
that would impair my judgement.  
• I will not compete at the Event.
• I will be willing to answer the questions of stakeholders (including but not limited to Athletes,
Owners and Trainers, Organisers, Grooms and my colleagues). I will take the time to politely
and objectively explain my decisions where possible.  
• I will be familiar with all the relevant FEI Rules and Regulations and will be well prepared for
every Event.
• I will cooperate with the Organiser of the Event and with my colleagues.
• I will be punctual and dress appropriately.
I commit to avoid any actual or perceived conflict of interest. A conflict of interest is defined as any
personal, professional or financial relationship, including relationships of family members that could
influence or be perceived to influence objectivity when representing or conducting business or other
dealings for or on behalf of the FEI.
I will maintain a neutral, independent and fair position towards Athletes, Owners, Trainers, Grooms,
Organisers, other Officials and stakeholders. Financial and/or personal interests will never influence
my officiating duties and I will spare no effort to avoid any such perception. I agree not to make any
financial contributions, donations in cash or in-kind or otherwise to an Organiser in exchange for
being appointed as an Official to the Event. For the avoidance of any doubt, the direct payment of
travel expenses and/or accommodation expenses by an FEI Official is acceptable.
I will not engage in nationalistic judging.
Activities that lead or may lead to a conflict of interest when officiating at an FEI Event include but
are not limited to:
• Acting as a Chef d’Equipe or being responsible /co-responsible for selecting teams and/or
individuals or training Athletes within a NF present at the Event, if the teams and/or
individuals participate in a competition falling within the level and age group of the authority
of the Official.  
• Being the Owner/part-Owner of a Horse taking part in a competition that I am officiating at.
• Being in a situation of financial dependence or gaining financial profit from participating
Owners, Athletes, Trainers or Organisers (excluding any payment(s) permitted under the
FEI Rules and Regulations, such as per diems). The same rule applies with regard to National
Federations or other organisations involved in the Event, if the dependence exceeds a
regular employment. Employees of participating National Federations cannot act as
President of the Ground Jury, Chief Steward, Veterinary Delegates, or Course Designer at
Official International Events, International Championships and Games.

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 66

• Having a close personal relationship with an Athlete competing in a competition that I am
officiating at.  
• Having recently treated a Horse competing in a Competition that I am officiating at.
On becoming aware of a potential Conflict of Interest I undertake to promptly notify the FEI HQ (or
where the conflict only arises and/or is identified on-site, the President of the Ground Jury) of any of
the above or other possible conflicts of interest or circumstances that may be perceived as such.
Conflicts must be avoided whenever practicable. However, conflicts may be linked to experience and
expertise that is necessary to qualify Officials. The specific balance between conflict and expertise is
regulated by the General Regulations and the relevant Sport Rules.
In the course of my duties or when representing the FEI I will refrain from making any public
statements, including to the media or in social media, that might cause harm to the FEI or to
equestrian sport in general. This includes statements that might create a perception of bias.  
I will not place bets on Athletes and Horses competing at FEI Events or otherwise receive any financial
or other gain as a product of a particular result.
The breach of any obligation assumed under this Code of Conduct and/or any breach of the FEI Rules
and Regulations may lead to any of the following sanctions as stipulated in the FEI Rules:
• Warning letter
• Obligation to attend an FEI course and/or to pass an exam
• Fine
• Suspension from officiating duties (provisional or for a stated period of time)
• Removal from the relevant and appropriate FEI lists of Officials
• Any other sanctions as stated in the relevant FEI Rules and Regulations.

APPENDIX I – FEI SAFEGUARDING POLICY AGAINST
HARASSMENT AND ABUSE

Consistent with the objectives and principles of the FEI, the welfare of the equestrian community,
especially minors and adults at risk1, is of paramount concern. When any member of the equestrian
community, such as an Athlete, Support Personnel, Coach, Trainer, Groom, Official, volunteer or
staff member - is subjected to or engages in abuse or misconduct, it undermines the mission of FEI
and is inconsistent with the best interests of equestrian sport. All forms of harassment and abuse
are prohibited and the FEI will take appropriate action pursuant to this Policy where there is a risk
of harm within the context of participation in equestrian sport.

The FEI is committed to promoting a safe environment for its members, Athletes, Support
Personnel, Coaches, Trainers, Grooms, Officials, volunteers and staff in all equestrian Disciplines.
The FEI has developed and adopted this Policy to set forth the efforts it will undertake to promote
a safe equestrian environment, both independently and in partnership with other necessary
parties, including National Federations, parents (or legal guardians), Athletes, and the equestrian
community.

ARTICLE 1 - Definitions and Application

1.1 Definitions
1.1.1 Harassment and Abuse

Harassment and abuse can be expressed in five forms which may occur in combination or in isolation.
These include i) psychological abuse, ii) physical abuse, iii) sexual harassment, iv) sexual abuse, and
v) neglect.

These forms of abuse are defined as:

1.  Psychological abuse — means any unwelcome act including confinement, isolation,
    verbal assault, humiliation, intimidation, infantilisation, or any other treatment which
    may diminish the sense of identity, dignity, and self-worth.

2.  Physical abuse — means any deliberate and unwelcome act – such as for example
    punching, beating, kicking, biting and burning – that causes physical trauma or injury.
    Such act can also consist of forced or inappropriate physical activity (e.g., age- or
    physique- inappropriate training loads; when injured or in pain), forced alcohol
    consumption, or forced doping practices.

3.  Sexual harassment — any unwanted and unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,
    whether verbal, non-verbal or physical. Sexual harassment can take the form of sexual
    abuse.

4.  Sexual abuse — any conduct of a sexual nature, whether non-contact, contact or
    penetrative, where consent is coerced/manipulated or is not or cannot be given.

5.  Neglect — within the meaning of this Policy means the failure of a coach or another
    person with a duty of care towards the Covered Individual to provide a minimum level
    of care to the Covered Individual, which is causing harm, allowing harm to be caused,
    or creating an imminent danger of harm.

Harassment and abuse can be based on any grounds including race, religion, colour, creed, ethnic
origin, physical attributes, gender, sexual orientation, age disability, socio-economic status and
athletic ability. It can include a one-off incident or a series of incidents. It may be in-person or online.

Harassment and abuse often result from an abuse of authority, meaning the improper use of a
position of influence, power or authority by an individual against another person.

1 Adults at risk is defined as “any person aged 18 or older who is engaged in activities in connection with the FEI (whether as
a Participant or otherwise) and who is, or may be, vulnerable to or unable to protect themselves against harm or the risk of
it (whether generally or a result of circumstances in which they find themselves at the relevant time)

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 68

1.  Athlete as defined in Appendix A of the GRs;  
2.  Accredited Persons at an FEI Event and/or FEI Meeting
3.  FEI Representatives, such as FEI Board Members, Members of a Technical or Standing
    Committee or Sub-Committee thereof, other members of a body or group designated by any
    of the former to act on behalf of or advise the FEI (including but not limited to working
    groups and task forces), and FEI employees;
4.  Officials as defined in Appendix A of the GRs;
5.  Organiser as defined in Appendix A of the GRs;

    Responsible participating in or preparing for an FEI Event.

1.1.3. Protected Person means any individual participant in equestrian sport, including Athletes,
Support Personnel, Coaches, Trainers, Grooms, Officials, volunteers and staff in all
equestrian Disciplines.

1.2 Application

1.2.1. This Policy shall apply to all Covered Individuals.

1.2.2. It shall be the personal responsibility of every Covered Individuals to make themselves
aware of this Policy including, without limitation, what conduct constitutes a violation of this
Policy and to comply with those requirements. Covered Individuals should also be aware
that conduct prohibited under this Policy may also constitute a criminal offence and/or a
breach of other applicable laws and regulations including other regulations of FEI or any
other Sports Organisations. Covered Individuals must comply with all applicable laws and
regulations at all times.

ARTICLE 2 - Violations

The following conduct constitutes a violation of this Policy:

2.1 Psychological Abuse;
2.2 Physical Abuse;
2.3 Sexual Harassment;
2.4 Sexual Abuse;
2.5 Neglect;
2.6 Engaging, or attempting or threatening to engage, in conduct that directly harms the
physical and/or mental welfare and/or safety of one or more Protected Persons;
2.7 Posing a risk of harm\*1to the physical and/or mental welfare and/or safety of one or more

type of intentional complicity involving a violation of this Policy:
2.9 Retaliation as defined in 3.1

- ‘Harm’ is not a narrow concept and can mean different things in different contexts, but (in very
  general terms) it can be considered as meaning ill-treatment or the impairment of health, welfare
  or development. Harassment and abuse are examples of conduct that cause harm.

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 69

2.10 Failure to cooperate

1.  Failing to cooperate with any investigation carried out by, or on behalf of, the FEI
    in relation to a possible breach of this Policy, including, without limitation, failing to provide
    accurately, completely and without undue delay any information and/or documentation
    and/or access or assistance requested by the FEI as part of such investigation.

2.  Obstructing or delaying any investigation that may be carried out by, or on behalf
    of, the FEI in relation to a possible violation of this Policy, including without limitation
    concealing, tampering with or destroying any documentation or other information that may
    be relevant to the investigation.

It is not necessary for conduct (or attempted or threatened conduct) to take place in the context of
equestrian sport in order for action to be taken pursuant to this Policy, provided that the FEI considers
that any such conduct suggests a risk of harm to one or more Protected Person in the context of
their participation in equestrian sport. For example (and without limitation), in the event that a
Covered Individual has at any time been convicted of, warned/cautioned for, or charged with, any
offence that concerns relevant harm to other individuals (whether or not those individuals are
Protected Persons), that may form the basis of action under this Policy as a result of that Covered
Individual posing a risk of harm to one or more Protected Person in the context of their participation
in equestrian sport (regardless of whether or not the relevant offence, or alleged offence, took place
in the context of equestrian sport). For the avoidance of doubt, conduct that took place prior to this
Policy coming into effect may indicate a risk of harm within the meaning of Article 2.7.
ARTICLE 3 – Retaliation, Reporting, and Confidentiality

Covered Individuals should report to the FEI, at the first available opportunity, full details of any
incident, fact or matter that comes to their attention or of which they are aware that could amount
to a violation of this Policy.
The FEI will report any behaviour, which in the reasonable opinion of the FEI, amounts to potentially
criminal behaviour to the appropriate legal authorities.

3.1 Retaliation  
Retaliation is any adverse action taken by a Covered Individual against a person participating in any
investigation or proceedings initiated by the FEI pursuant to this Policy. Retaliation by a Covered
Individual against a person for making an allegation, supporting a reporting party, or providing
information relevant to an allegation is a serious violation of this Policy.

3.2 Reporting Harassment and Abuse at any time, including at FEI Events  
For reporting any Harassment or Abuse, the FEI and/or the ECIU will take a report in the way that is
most comfortable for the person initiating the report including an anonymous, in-person, verbal, or
written report. Regardless of the method of reporting, it is helpful to the FEI and/or the ECIU to get
the following information: (1) the name of the complainant(s); (2) the type of misconduct alleged;
(3) the name(s) of the alleged victim(s); and (4) the name(s) of the individual(s) alleged to have
committed the misconduct.
Individuals may complete an Incident Report Form. Information on this form will include:  
1. The name(s) of the complainant(s);  
2. The type of misconduct alleged (including psychological abuse, physical abuse, sexual
harassment, sexual abuse, and neglect);  
3. The name(s) of the alleged victim(s);  
4. The name(s) of the individual(s) alleged to have committed the misconduct;  
5. The approximate date(s) and location(s) where the misconduct was committed;  
6. The names of other individuals who might have information regarding the alleged
misconduct; and  
7. A summary statement of the reasons to believe that misconduct has occurred.

The FEI will withhold the complainant’s name upon request, to the extent permitted by law. A copy
of the FEI Incident Report Form can be found at www.inside.fei.org.

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 70

3.3. Confidentiality  
To the extent permitted by law, and as appropriate, the FEI and/or the ECIU will handle any report
it receives confidentially and discreetly and will not make public the names of the complainant(s),
potential victim(s), or accused person(s); however, the FEI may disclose such names on a limited
basis when conducting an investigation, or reporting to the ECIU, or the relevant bodies or when
required to do so under applicable law.

The FEI may update any individual who has filed a safeguarding report with the FEI on the status of
(i) their report; and/or (ii) the related safeguarding procedure (if applicable). The FEI’s provision of
such updates shall not constitute a violation of the confidentiality provisions of this Article 3.3.

3.4. Anonymous Reporting
The FEI recognises it can be difficult to report an allegation of misconduct and strives to remove as
many barriers to reporting as possible. Anonymous reports may be made without the formality of
completing an Incident Report Form:  
1. by completing the FEI Incident Report Form without including their name;  
2. by expressing concerns of misconduct to the FEI and/or the ECIU; or  
3. by expressing concerns in writing or verbally to one of the individuals on the Safeguarding
Protection Team.
Safeguarding Protection Team: The Safeguarding Protection Team shall be composed of individuals
as designated by the FEI Legal Director and its role is to protect individuals from harm, to promote
a safe environment, and to ensure any safeguarding concerns are addressed swiftly and
appropriately.
Please be aware that anonymous reporting may make it difficult to investigate or properly address
allegations.
ARTICLE 4 – FEI Investigation, Notification
Following the receipt of an allegation of a misconduct, the FEI may consider the circumstances in
which it will notify other Athletes and/or the parents (or legal guardians) of Athletes with whom the
accused individual may have had contact. At the FEI’s discretion, and as appropriate or required by
law, the FEI may notify relevant persons, i.e., competition managers, staff members, contractors,
volunteers, parents (or legal guardians), and/or Athletes of any such allegation that (a) law
enforcement authorities are actively investigating; or (b) that the FEI and/or the ECIU is
investigating. Advising others of an allegation may lead to additional reports of harassment or abuse
and other misconduct.
ARTICLE 5 – Opening a Safeguarding Procedure
Following an investigation by or on behalf of the FEI and/or the ECIU pursuant to this Policy, the FEI
shall evaluate all the evidence and shall decide whether or not to open a safeguarding procedure by
referring the matter to the FEI Tribunal.
Any case referred to the FEI Tribunal pursuant to this Policy will be dealt with according to the
procedures set out in the Internal Regulations of the FEI Tribunal. Where appropriate, the FEI may
wait until the outcome of any related criminal or civil investigation and/or proceedings is known
before deciding whether or not to refer a case to the FEI Tribunal.

ARTICLE 6 – Jurisdiction & Appeal
6.1. The FEI Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to decide on alleged breaches of this Policy in the
first instance according to the process set out in Chapter VIII of the GRs (The Legal System).
The FEI Tribunal may, either on its own initiative or upon the application of one or all of the
parties concerned, stay the proceedings before the FEI Tribunal pending the outcome of any
related criminal or civil investigation and/or proceedings.

6.2 An Appeal may be lodged against a Decision of the FEI Tribunal in accordance with Article
162 (Appeals) of the GRs.

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 71

ARTICLE 7 – Provisional Measures

7.1. The FEI may impose provisional measures, including a provisional suspension, on the
Covered Individual. The FEI shall also be entitled to recognise and apply Provisional
Suspensions and/or provisional measures imposed by other bodies, such as National
Federations or Safeguarding authorities. Where a provisional measure is imposed or
recognised and applied by the FEI, a Covered Individual shall be entitled to apply to the FEI
Tribunal for relief against such provisional measures, including the lifting of a Provisional
Suspension.

7.2. Where a provisional measure is imposed, this shall be taken into consideration in the
determination of any sanction which may ultimately be imposed.

ARTICLE 8 – Sanctions

8.1. Where it is determined that a violation has been committed, the FEI Tribunal shall impose
an appropriate sanction upon the Covered Individual from the range of permissible sanctions
set out in Article 164 (Sanctions) of the GRs, including a lifetime ban.

8.2. When determining the appropriate sanctions applicable, the FEI Tribunal shall take into
consideration all aggravating and mitigating circumstances and shall detail the effect of such
circumstances on the final sanction in the written decision.

8.3 The FEI shall be entitled to prevent any person (regardless of whether they are a Covered
Individual or not) convicted of a criminal offence which would constitute a violation of this
Policy from participating in any meetings or activities surrounding any Competition or Event,
including as a spectator.

ARTICLE 9 – Mutual Recognition
9.1. Subject to the right of appeal, any decision taken by the FEI pursuant to this Policy must be
recognised and respected by all National Federations.

9.2 Where the FEI is informed that a Covered Individual has been:
(i) convicted of a criminal offence which would constitute a violation of this Policy;
or  
(ii) held by their National Federation or any other competent sports governing body
to which the Covered Individual is subject, to have committed a violation which
would constitute a violation under this Policy, the FEI shall recognise the applicable
conviction/decision imposed.

Where appropriate, the FEI reserves the right to open a separate safeguarding procedure
against the Covered Individual in relation to their FEI related activities.

ARTICLE 10 –Duty to inform  
National Federations shall promptly inform the FEI of any allegations (where possible) and/or
sanction(s) imposed on any person under their jurisdiction relating to any conduct falling within the
scope of Article 2 of this Policy.  
The FEI shall promptly inform the National Federations of any allegations (where possible) and/or
sanction(s) imposed on any person under their jurisdiction relating to any conduct falling within the
scope of Article 2 of this Policy.

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 72

APPENDIX J – Rationale for the Unsanctioned Events
Provisions

1.  The primary mission of the FEI, as the world governing body of equestrian sport, is ‘to
    advance the orderly growth of equestrian sport worldwide by promoting, administering and
    regulating humane and sportsmanlike international competition in the traditional equestrian
    Disciplines’.

2.  At the core of that mission are the following two fundamental principles:

2.1 In each equestrian Discipline, the welfare of the Horse must be the paramount
consideration at all times. It must never, in any circumstances, be subordinated to
competitive or commercial considerations.

2.2 Equestrian sport depends, for its credibility, on public acceptance derived from the
integrity of its competitions. Behind this precept lies the premise that the best Athletes
should win fairly and squarely, having competed under even and equitable conditions and
under Rules that are themselves fair, realistic, and applied with scrupulous competence and
even-handedness. No result can be meaningful or valid if it has not been achieved on a level
playing-field.

1.  The FEI can only protect and promote those two principles by putting in place detailed
    Regulations protecting Horse welfare and competition integrity (such as the FEI Code of
    Conduct for the Welfare of the Horse, the FEI Veterinary Regulations, and the FEI Equine
    Controlled Medication Rules) and the integrity of Competition (such as the FEI Anti-Doping
    Rules For Human Athletes and the FEI Equine Anti-Doping and Control Medications
    Regulations and the FEI Code On The Prevention Of The Manipulation Of Competitions and
    by making acceptance of International Events into the official Calendar conditional upon the
    Organiser adopting all of those Regulations and making them binding on all participants in
    those Events. Only by these means can the FEI ensure the uniform application of the
    necessary Regulations in all International Events, and hold all Event Organisers and
    participants accountable under those Regulations for conducting themselves in a manner
    that protects the safety and integrity of the sport.

2.  In recent years, equestrian sport has seen an increase in the number of events being
    promoted by private entrepreneurs who avoid regulation by and accountability to the FEI by
    organising their events outside of the official Calendar. Such Unsanctioned Events threaten
    to undermine the FEI’s ability to achieve its mission in the following ways:

4.1 The core purpose of the official Calendar to ensure that undue demands are not
placed on Horses or Athletes participating in International Events. Unsanctioned events
circumvent (and so undermine) those protections.

4.2 Unsanctioned Events are not subject to FEI Regulations, and their organisers and
participants are not accountable to the FEI for compliance with such regulations. As a result,
the FEI has no way of safeguarding the welfare of Horses and Athletes participating in such
events, or of protecting the integrity of the events. The same may be true at the national
level if a national event is conducted outside national rules and even in circumstances where
the National Federation expressly objected.

4.3 This presents a risk of great harm to the sport both directly (through physical harm
to Horses and Athletes participating in Unsanctioned Events) and indirectly (by undermining
public confidence in the ability of the FEI to protect the safety and integrity of the sport).
The public is unlikely to appreciate fully the distinction between sanctioned and Unsanctioned
Events, and so if problems occur in Unsanctioned Events the image of the entire sport will
suffer, and public confidence in the ability of the FEI to maintain the integrity of the sport
and to protect the welfare of its participants will be undermined, to the great detriment of
the sport as a whole.

1.  The FEI recognises the need to be proportionate in its regulation of the sport, and in
    particular to intervene no further than is necessary to protect the sporting imperatives
    identified above.

Therefore:

5.1 The Unsanctioned Event provisions do not prevent Athletes or Officials participating
in Unsanctioned Events, or Owners entering their Horses in Unsanctioned Events, if they so

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 73

choose. Instead, reflecting the principle that those who benefit from the collective efforts
of the FEI and its stakeholders should not at the same time participate in activities that
undermine those efforts, it prevents simultaneous participation in both sanctioned and
Unsanctioned Events, by making any Athlete, Horse or Official that participates in an
Unsanctioned Event ineligible to participate for a specified period in sanctioned events.

5.2 It limits the period of ineligibility to six months, in the hope that this will be sufficient
to protect against the risks identified above. It also allows for a waiver of that period of
ineligibility in exceptional circumstances. If this limited period of ineligibility proves to be
insufficient, it will be reviewed and (if necessary) lengthened.

5.3 It is not triggered by participation in Unsanctioned Events that the National
Federations authorise or have no express objection to, such as local events run outside the
NF structure but with the knowledge and acceptance of the NF. Again, however, if this is
abused, it may be necessary to revisit and tighten the regulation.

APPENDIX K – Calendar Application Procedure and
consequences of cancellations of Jumping Events

All references to 5\* and 4\* Jumping Events in this Appendix include:
o CSI;
o CSIO; and
o FEI World Cup Events.

1.1. Calendar Application Fees and Calendar Application Deposit

A. The Calendar Application Fees as specified in FEI Financial Charges apply.
B. Each Calendar Application for a 4\* and 5\* Jumping Event taking place on or after 1 January
2024 is subject to the payment of a deposit (a “Calendar Application Deposit”) in the amount specified
in the table below.
Upon receipt of the Calendar Application, the FEI will issue an invoice to the NF for the applicable
Calendar Application Deposit, such invoice to be paid within 30 days.  
The Calendar Application Deposit paid in relation to an Event will be credited against the related
Organising Dues payable to the FEI after that Event has taken place.
CALENDAR APPLICATION DEPOSIT
5*: CHF 10’000
4*: CHF 5’000

If the Event is cancelled (other than by reason of a Force Majeure Event), the FEI will retain the
Calendar Application Deposit and it will not be credited against Organising Dues of future Events of
the Organiser (or Related Organiser). For more details about Cancellations see section 1.4 below.
1.2. Late Date Application Fee and Date Changes to the Approved Calendar
Any Late Date Application Fee and Date Changes to the Calendar Fee as specified in the FEI Financial
Charges shall apply. Calendar Application Deposits are also payable for Late Date Applications and
the process set out in paragraph 1.1 above shall apply, it being understood and agreed that the FEI
Secretary General may take appropriate action including the removal of the Event if the applicable
Calendar Application Deposit has not been paid.
1.3. Calendar Applications for 5\* Jumping Events
Applications for all CSI5\* and CSIO5\* Events must be received by the FEI Secretary General by 1
May prior to the year in which the Event takes place1.
Dates must be subsequently confirmed by the National Federations/OCs by 1 June of the year before
the Event takes place. The FEI Secretary General shall then approve the Calendar for all 5\* Jumping
Events for the following year in principle by 31 July. If 31 July falls on a non-business day in Lausanne,
Switzerland, the Calendar shall be approved on the following business day.

1 For the avoidance of any doubt, NFs may send Calendar Applications for CSI5\* and CSIO5\* by 1 May 2023 for Events
taking place in 2024 and such Calendar Applications are not considered as Late Date Applications.

General Regulations, 24th edition, 1 January 2020, updates effective 1 January 2026 75
